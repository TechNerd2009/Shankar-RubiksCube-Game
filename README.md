## 🚀 Technologies Used
* **📄 HTML5:** Structures the web page and buttons.
* **🎨 CSS3:** Styles the page elements, including the control buttons for a modern look.
* **💻 JavaScript (ES Modules):** Handles the core logic, cube mechanics, animations, and user interactions.
* **🧊 Three.js (r163):** The powerful WebGL library used for creating and rendering the 3D scene and cube.
